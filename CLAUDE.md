# Ticket Manager Project - Claude Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive web application that allows users to extract tickets from PDFs, overlay custom designs while preserving QR codes, and download the modified PDFs. The system automatically detects QR code regions and protects them from being covered by the overlay design.

## Key Requirements & Critical Features
- Extract tickets from uploaded PDFs
- Allow users to upload custom designs for overlay (PNG/JPG)
- **Critical**: QR code areas must NOT be overlaid (preserved for scanning)
- Provide real-time preview of the overlay before final processing
- Allow users to download the modified PDF
- Modern web-based interface for ease of use
- Support for multi-page PDFs
- Adjustable opacity and QR code protection padding

## Project Architecture

### Backend Components
1. **app.py** - Main Flask backend API
   - Full-featured REST API with CORS support
   - File upload handling (PDFs and images)
   - Advanced QR code detection using multiple methods
   - PDF manipulation with PyMuPDF (fitz)
   - Design overlay application with opacity control
   - Preview generation capabilities
   - Endpoints: `/health`, `/upload`, `/process`

2. **standalone.py** - Simplified Flask backend
   - Lightweight version for testing
   - Basic upload and processing endpoints
   - Alternative implementation approach

### Frontend Components
1. **Astro Framework Implementation** - Modern web application
   - **src/pages/index.astro** - Main application page
   - **src/components/FileUpload.astro** - Reusable upload component
   - **src/layouts/Layout.astro** - Base layout template
   - Uses DaisyUI (Tailwind CSS) for modern UI components
   - Drag-and-drop file upload functionality
   - Real-time preview with QR code protection visualization
   - Opacity and padding control sliders
   - Progress indicators and user feedback alerts
   - TypeScript integration for type safety

2. **Legacy HTML Implementations** (reference)
   - Previous standalone HTML implementations
   - Maintained for compatibility and testing

### Development Infrastructure
1. **start-dev.sh** - Development environment launcher
   - Automatically starts both Flask (port 5000) and Astro (port 4321) servers
   - Dependency checking and installation
   - Cross-platform support (Docker and local)
   - Process management and cleanup

2. **Package Management**
   - **package.json** - Node.js dependencies (Astro, Tailwind, DaisyUI)
   - **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies (Flask, PyMuPDF, OpenCV, etc.)

## Technical Implementation Details

### QR Code Detection System
The application implements a robust three-tier QR code detection system:

1. **Direct Detection**: Uses pyzbar library for standard QR code recognition
2. **Enhanced Detection**: Preprocesses images with thresholding and contrast enhancement
3. **Contour-based Fallback**: Detects square shapes that might be QR codes when other methods fail

### Design Overlay Process
- Supports PNG/JPG design uploads with validation
- Automatic image resizing to fit PDF page dimensions
- Adjustable opacity (0-100%) for design transparency
- Configurable padding around QR codes for protection
- Preserves original QR code functionality while applying design

### Frontend-Backend Integration
- RESTful API communication between Astro frontend and Flask backend
- FormData for file uploads with multipart encoding
- JSON API for processing requests
- Real-time preview updates based on user settings
- Download handling for processed PDFs

## API Documentation

### Endpoints
1. **GET /health**
   - Returns: Server status and health check
   - Use: Verify backend connectivity

2. **POST /upload**
   - Parameters: FormData with `pdf` (file), `design` (file), `opacity` (float 0-1)
   - Returns: JSON with PDF analysis and QR code locations
   - Use: Initial file processing and analysis

3. **POST /process**
   - Parameters: JSON with `pdf_filename`, `design_filename`, `opacity`, `padding`
   - Returns: Binary PDF file
   - Use: Generate final overlay and download

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive validation for file types and sizes
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- User-friendly error messages and alerts
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers

## Development Workflow
1. **Setup**: Run `./start-dev.sh` to start both servers
2. **Frontend Development**: Modify Astro components in `src/`
3. **Backend Development**: Edit `app.py` for API changes
4. **Testing**: Use both servers running simultaneously
5. **Deployment**: Build Astro (`npm run build`) and deploy Flask app

## Security Considerations
- File type validation and sanitization
- Filename security and path traversal prevention
- File size limits (50MB max)
- CORS configuration restricts origins
- Temporary file cleanup
- Input validation on all API endpoints

## Performance Optimizations
- Efficient PDF processing with PyMuPDF
- Optimized QR detection algorithms
- Client-side file validation before upload
- Progressive loading for large files
- Memory management for large PDFs

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Batch Processing**: Multiple PDF processing simultaneously
2. **Template Library**: Save and reuse popular design templates
3. **Advanced Positioning**: Manual drag-and-drop design placement
4. **Multi-page Designs**: Different designs for different pages
5. **Cloud Integration**: AWS S3/Google Cloud storage integration
6. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users working on designs
7. **Mobile App**: Native mobile application
8. **API Expansion**: Full RESTful API for third-party integration
9. **Analytics**: Usage tracking and optimization insights
10. **A/B Testing**: Design effectiveness measurement
